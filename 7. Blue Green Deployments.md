## Blue Green Deployment 

The purpose of this short lab is to demonstrate how simple it is to implement Blue-Green Deployments in OpenShift v3.

"Blue-green deployment is a release strategy that can be utilized by developers for deploying software in a production environment. Blue can be one particular production environment whereas green can define an identical production environment. Under blue-green deployment strategy, software developers are able to minimize downtime and reduce risk." 1*

In this Lab, we will be:

* Deploying two versions of the same application. The first version will display a blue rectangle.
* Create a FQDN that can be used to expose the applications.
* We will first expose the first application.
* We will also create another version of this application in the same project that displays a green rectangle.
* We will then switch the FQDN to from the first application (blue) to the second application (green)

In this exercise, you will need to fork a git repo in order to make changes from the source.
**Lab #6: Blue Green Deployment**


1. In order to be able to edit the source, you will need to fork a copy of the source git repo. There are two options you can do in the lab:
	* Option #1) Logging into the internal bitbucket instance and fork https://bitbucket-eng-chn-sjc1.cisco.com/bitbucket/scm/cctgdev/ocpworkshop-bluegreen.git if you have a login to the internal bitbucket.
		* access https://bitbucket-eng-chn-sjc1.cisco.com/bitbucket/scm/cctgdev/ocpworkshop-bluegreen.git
		* login to the git repository
		* fork the above git rep
		* Go to setting --> security --> enable public access
		
	* Option #2) forking from https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/bluegreen.git 
		* if you do have a login to github.com, you can create one for free.
		* Access to https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/bluegreen.git and fork this git repo via broswer
		
2. From your browser, go to https://ocp-master.ccatg.cisco.com:8443
2. If you have not logged in, do the following
	1. Select cisco_ldap_provider under Log in with...
	2. Enter your LDAP id and password
	3. Click login
3. If you already logged in, click home icon ![image](images/home.jpg)
4. Click on your project name `username-proj` 
6. Click Add project
7. From the Browse Catalog, type `php`
8. Select PHP 5.6
9. Add bluegreen as Name and the git repo URL that you fork from https://bitbucket-eng-chn-sjc1.cisco.com/bitbucket/scm/<your_name>/ocpworkshop-bluegreen.git in step #1
10. Click `Continue to Overview` and it will bring you back to Overview page
11. Click `View Log` -> click `follow` and wait until you see `Push successful`
12. Click `Overview`
13. Click onto the route to view the application
14. To edit the source, follow the instruction per your option based on step #1.
	* Option #1: using internal bitbucket instance
		1. Click onto the middle of the blue cirle (Pod)
		2. Click onto the name of the pod
		3. Click Terminal tab
		4. you are now accessing the container and run the following command at the prompt
		
		````
		$ ls
		$ vi image.php
		change source code:
