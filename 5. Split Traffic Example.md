## Split Traffic 

**Load Balancing for A/B Testing**

You can run two versions of an application, and, entirely within OpenShift Container Platform, control the percentage of traffic to and from each application for A/B testing. A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

Previously, A/B testing only worked by adding or removing more pods of every kind (A or B). However, this was not a scalable solution because for lower B percentages, you would create a large number of pods. Starting in 3.3, the HAProxy router now supports splitting the traffic coming to a route across multiple back end services via weighting.

11. To test split traffic, we need to deploy one more php application
12. Click `Overview` on left menu 
13. 6. Click `Add to Project`
14. From the Browse Catalog, type `php`
15. Select PHP 5.6
16. Add `phpapp-two` as Name and https://github.com/piggyvenus/simplephp.git as git repo URL.
17. Click `Continue to Overview` and it will bring you back to Overview page
18. Click `View Log` 
19. Click `Overview`
20. Check the routes for both PHP apps and make sure they are working after both pods are running (the blue circle shows)
21. Go `Application` on left menu → Select `Routes`
22. Click `phpapp-one` 
23. Click `Action` on top right corner → select `Edit`
24. Click onto `Split traffic across multiple services`
25. Select the 1st service as phpapp-one with 50 weight and alternate service as phpapp-two and 50 weight

28. Go to Lab #1 web console browser `http://webclient-<your_lab1_project>.apps.ccatg.cisco.com/` and run the following commands:

````
oc project <username-proj>
oc get routes
oc annotate route/phpapp-one haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
curl phpapp-one-<username-proj>.apps.ccatg.cisco.com 
curl phpapp-one-<username-proj>.apps.ccatg.cisco.com
````
you will notice that the response of first curl request is different from the 2nd curl request.


Congrats! you have completed Lab #4 on OpenShift.
