## Split Traffic 

**Load Balancing for A/B Testing**

You can run two versions of an application, and, entirely within OpenShift Container Platform, control the percentage of traffic to and from each application for A/B testing. A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

Previously, A/B testing only worked by adding or removing more pods of every kind (A or B). However, this was not a scalable solution because for lower B percentages, you would create a large number of pods. Starting in 3.3, the HAProxy router now supports splitting the traffic coming to a route across multiple back end services via weighting.
