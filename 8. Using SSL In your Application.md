## Using SSL in your application

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate

**Lab #7: Using SSL in your application**

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We will be using the **username-proj** that you created in the previous labs. 

1. From your browser, go to https://ocp-master.ccatg.cisco.com:8443
2. Select cisco_ldap_provider under Log in with...
3. Enter your LDAP id and password
4. Click login if you are not login
5. Click on your project name `username-proj` 
6. Now, let enable HTTPS for the route, OpenShift has a `wildcard` SSL certificate that it can use for any application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is sometimes called SSL-offloading).
7. Click `Application` —> select route 
8. Click `bluegreen` rout
9. Click `Action` on top right corner —> select Edit
10. Select `edge` under TLS Termination
11. Click Save
12. Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://` URI

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL from your application
