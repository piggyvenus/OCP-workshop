## Using SSL in your application

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate

**Lab #7: Using SSL in your application**

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We will be using the **username-proj** that you created in the previous labs. 

1. From your browser, go to https://ocp-master.ccatg.cisco.com:8443
2. 2. If you have not logged in, do the following
	1. Select cisco_ldap_provider under Log in with...
	2. Enter your LDAP id and password
	3. Click login
3. If you already logged in, click home icon ![image](images/home.jpg)
4. Click on your project name `username-proj` 
5. Now, let's enable HTTPS for the route, OpenShift has a `wildcard` SSL certificate that it can use for any application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is sometimes called SSL-offloading).
6. Click `Application` —> select `Routes` 
7. Click `bluegreen` route
8. Click `Action` on top right corner —> select Edit
9. Click `Show options for secured routes`
10. Select `Edge` under TLS Termination
11. Click `Save`
12. Click `Overview`
12. Click the route from the top right corner and your URL is using the `https://` 

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL from your application
