## Scale up/down and Rolling Back Application 
In this exercise we will learn how to scale our application. OpenShift has the capability to scale your application and make sure that many instances are always running. Also, you can rollback to the previous version from teh Web UI.

**Lab #6: Scaling and Rolling Back Application**

1. From your browser, go to https://ocp-master.ccatg.cisco.com:8443
2. Select cisco_ldap_provider under Log in with...
3. Enter your LDAP id and password
4. Click login if you are not login
5. Click on your project name `username-proj`
6. Click `Deployment`, select phpapp-one
7. Click `Action` and select Edit Yaml to view the `Deployment Config` (dc)
	- Note that the `replicas:` is set to `1`. This tells OpenShift that when this application deploys, make sure that there is 1 instance.
	- The `replicationController` mirrors this configuration initially; the `replicationController` (or `rc`) will ensure that there is always the set number of instances always running.
	- You can change the number of replicas in DeploymentConfig or the ReplicationController.
	- However note that if you change the deploymentConfig it applies to your application. This means, even if you delete the current replication controller, the new one that gets created will be assigned the REPLICAS value based on what is set for DC. If you change it on the Replication Controller, the application will scale up. But if you happen to delete the current replication controller for some reason, you will loose that setting.
8. Click `Overview`
9. In phpapp-one section, you will see  ![image](images/scale_up.jpg) and ![image](images/scale_down.jpg) icons next to the blue pod circle.
9. Click onto ![image](images/scale_up.jpg) twice and you now have 3 pods phpapp-one
10. Click onto ![image](images/scale_down.jpg) once and now you will have 2 pods 
11. Click `Application` and select `Pods`
12. Click onto one of the running pod
13. Click `Action` and select Delete
14. Click `Delete` to confirm
15. When 1 of pod is deleted, replication controller will create one immediately per the number of replica is configured in the deployment config.
20. Now, Let's check out how to rollback your application. Click`Application` on left nav —> select Deployment
21. Alternatively, you can also scale up and down via command line.
22. Click `deploy` button on the top right
23. Click `Overview` and watch the pods redeploy. Two pods will be restarted with the new deployment automatically
24. To Roll back to different version of the deployment, click `Application` —> select Deployment
25. Click phpapp-one
26. Scroll to the bottom, click #1 
27. Click `Roll Back` under Details tab
28. Click `Roll Back` again to confirm to rollback version #1
29. Congrats! you have completed Lab #6.
